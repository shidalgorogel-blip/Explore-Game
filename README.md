This is an exploring game where monsters will try to attack you on your adventure! It's important not to flee because you will lose points towards your score! Make sure to spell out "explore castle" or "explore forest"
whenn choosing locations! When in the main menu you can always check your status!
Good luck fellow explorer! Have Fun!!
